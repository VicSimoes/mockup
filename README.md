#Medical Profile Web App

Create a web app that has a medical profiles for patients. Doctors, staff, patients, and family can share information (a bit like facebook).

1. As an authorized user, I should be able to upload information.

2. As a user, profile should give holistic view of all patients symptoms and conditions. Current medications, allergies, disabilities and illnesses, family medical history, medical history, etc.

3. As a user, site should provide different views - i.e. profile view for doctor is different from profile view of authorized family member.

4. As a patient, I should be able to send messages to doctor/medical staff directly and vice-versa for follow ups, questions, etc.

5. As a patient, doctor or authorized caretaker, site should warn user of potential druc interactions, site should check symptoms for severity, etc. and site should have links to relevant information on health issue.
